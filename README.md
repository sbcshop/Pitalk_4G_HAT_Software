## Setup PiTalk 4G HAT with RPi 

To Start working with our PiTalk 4G HAT, set-up your Raspberry Pi or RockPi by flashing their os file and boot it, for this [click here](https://rockpi.eu/Rockpi4/downloads).

* After setup your Pi board, attach the PiTalk 4 HAT on it and boot by providing compatible power supply.
* Now, open the command prompt and type the following command to clone the current repository in your Pi-board.
```
git clone https://github.com/sbcshop/Pitalk_4G_HAT_Software.git
```

* After, downloading this repository you will see two directory in it. One is of ***Example code*** and 2nd one is of ***Library*** file.
* Now, open the both Example and Library directory. To open these files make sure you have python installed in your Pi board.
* In examples Directory there are some example codes to use the different functionality of PiTalk HAT you have ***move out the example file*** which you want to run from the ***Examples directory*** and after that run the code by make some editing if require.


## Setup PiTalk 4G  Via USB
