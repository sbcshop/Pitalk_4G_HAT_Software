The PiTalk 4G HAT is a handy, low-power Raspberry Pi HAT that features multi-communication functionalities such as GSM, GPRS, TCP, etc. It allows your Pi to easily make phone calls, send messages, connect to wireless networks, and so on. It is the most convenient IoT HAT that works with all variants of Raspberry Pi (model A, B and Zero). The users can also connect PiTalk with other iOS and Android devices as well. It is primarily designed to offer connection to your IoT projects and applications without requiring a Wi-Fi network or ethernet connections. 

## Features 

* Standard Raspberry Pi 40PIN GPIO extension header, supports Raspberry Pi series boards and Jetson Nano
* Supports SMS, phone call, GPRS, TCP/IP, DTMF, HTTP, FTPI, etc.
* UART interface, for connecting controller boards like Arduino/STM32
* Onboard voltage translator, 3.3V by default, switch to 5V via jumper
* 2x LED indicators, easy to monitor the working status
* SIM card slot supports 1.8V/3V SIM card
* Baudrate: 2400bps ~ 115200bps (115200bps by default)
* Control via AT commands (3GPP TS 27.007, 27.005, and SIMCOM enhanced AT Commands)
